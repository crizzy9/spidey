1) The sinks identified here are not actually sinks since we are only using a corpus of 1000 urls
and none of those 1000 are in these pages they are considered as sink nodes when they actually arent
Example:
a page like Wayback_Machine which has high number of inlinks(Rank 5 by inlink count) has zero
outlinks since none of the real outlinks of that page does not exist in the corpus

2) Zero inlink count doesnt make sense because if a page had zero inlink count it would be impossible to reach using a crawler
since there is no page that points to that page

3) The same problem of fake sinks exist in G2 also but the number is way less because in G2 most of the links exist at
a higher depth and the lower depth links are very few and hence a lot of lower links which were in the stack gets
removed but not the higher depth ones which results in less number of sinks compared to G1
